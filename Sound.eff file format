List of entries (each 84 bytes) with fields:
- Offset1 (uint): Looks like a memory address or file offset. For the last entry this is always zero.
- Field2 (uint): Almost always zero. Found 35420640 for the last entry of 'oot'.
- Field3 (uint): Always zero.
- ID (uint): Increases by one for each entry. Does not seem unique across all *_sounds.eff files.
- X (float): X coordinate of sphere where the sound is heard.
- Y (float): Y coordinate of sphere where the sound is heard.
- Z (float): Z coordinate of sphere where the sound is heard.
- Radius (float): Radius of sphere where the sound is heard.
- Offset2 (uint): Usually zero, although this can contain a large offset in Kunark or Velious zones. Seems to be set only when Duration and Offset3 are also set (exception: 'frozenshadow').
- Field10 (uint): Almost always zero. Found 6000 in 'wakening'.
- Duration (uint): Usually zero. Sometimes, a few thousands (most often n000, few occurences of n500). Unit could be ms. Found 2 in 'befallen'.
- Offset3 (uint): Usually zero. When set, large number that looks like a memory address. Seems to be set only when Duration and Offset2 are set.
- SoundID1 (uint): Either zero, 1-30ish or >=162. In the second case this is an index into the 'EMIT' entries of the zone's *_sndbnk.eff file. In the third case this is an index into the 'LOOP' entries of the same file.
- SoundID2 (uint): Usually either zero or the same value than SoundID1.
- Flags1 (ushort): Zero when SoundID1 >= 162. One or two when 1 <= SoundID1 < 160. Sometimes 0x0100 is ORd with this field. This could mean SoundID1 is an index into the zone's *.xmi file.
- Field16 (ushort): Unknown.
- Flags2 (uint): Usually zero or 0x64.
