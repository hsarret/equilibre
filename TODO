Investigate bug at b14679aa5754620619c84f220ffc500a7b7932d8 with AMD on Linux (r600g) where v_texFactor is sometimes set to something other than 1.0 even though u_lightingMode never changes.
Investigate bug with AMD on Linux (r600g) where there is corruption when using 2D texture array + mipmaps (sampling between layers)
