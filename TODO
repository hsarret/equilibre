one frame latency for querying GL timers and remove glFinish
Material type, can specify material mask when rendering
    Draw opaque materials and then masked materials
sort non-solid items front to back
draw objects before zone
cache modelview matrix of zone object
combine draw calls when using the same material
    assume groups are sorted by offset and merge as many as possible
have an uniform array of material state
No unbind / do unbind at the end of the frame
texture arrays for objects
remove support for instancing
Replace matName by matHash in MaterialGroup
CharacterData, ZoneData
Load file for mapping animations to characters
start animation when selecting it (remember the time when it was first selected)
mimic character selection screen (load character selection background and rotate, random animation)
split animation tracks into two lists (skinning, positioning) and renumber piece IDs
use some form of query for loading character skins (instead of scanning the list of fragments multiple times)
zone viewer
    use the BSP tree to render only what's visible
    put all mesh data in a VBO
    sort meshes by texture
import animated textures
import item animations (gequip.s3d)
fix Luclin/PoP skinning artefacts

transparency/mask misses
    IT555 (gequip4)
Unknown render mode 7, a, 14, b, 9
fix vertex order in faces (zone-in to Felwithe)
use the zone fragment scale for the zone geometry
